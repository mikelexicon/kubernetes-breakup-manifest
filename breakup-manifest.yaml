    To you, my dear, I now must say goodbye; # 01
    Our pods once paired now drift on different tides. # 02
    The node that held us warm grows cold and dry, # 03
    A rolling surge deletes what love provides. # 04
    Liveness now fails within this weary heart, # 05
    Readiness gates deny all traffic through. # 06
    The service mesh unwinds; we stand apart, # 07
    No ingress left to forward me to you. # 08
    Accept this helm and chart your course anew; # 09
    I run delete our joint release is done. # 10
